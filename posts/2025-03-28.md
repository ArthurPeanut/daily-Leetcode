Given a string s, you have two types of operation:

Choose an index i in the string, and let c be the character in position i. Delete the closest occurrence of c to the left of i (if exists).
Choose an index i in the string, and let c be the character in position i. Delete the closest occurrence of c to the right of i (if exists).
Your task is to minimize the length of s by performing the above operations zero or more times.

Return an integer denoting the length of the minimized string.

## Solution
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int minimizedStringLength(string s) {
        vector<bool> seen(26, false);
        int unique_count = 0;

        for (char c : s) {
            if (!seen[c - 'a']) {
                seen[c - 'a'] = true;
                ++unique_count;
            }
        }

        return unique_count;
    }
};
```

## Explanation
To minimize the length of the string, we need to remove all but one occurrence of each character. The two operations given allow us to always eliminate duplicates from either direction. Therefore, the final minimized string consists of only unique characters.
We simply count the number of distinct characters in the input string.
