You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array questions where questions[i] = [pointsi, brainpoweri].

The array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to process the questions in order (i.e., starting from question 0) and make a decision whether to solve or skip each question. Solving question i will earn you pointsi points but you will be unable to solve each of the next brainpoweri questions. If you skip question i, you get to make the decision on the next question.

For example, given questions = [[3, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4], [2, 5]]:
If question 0 is solved, you will earn 3 points but you will be unable to solve questions 1 and 2.
If instead, question 0 is skipped and question 1 is solved, you will earn 4 points but you will be unable to solve questions 2 and 3.
Return the maximum points you can earn for the exam.

## Solution
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    long long mostPoints(vector<vector<int>>& questions) {
        int n = questions.size();
        vector<long long> dp(n + 1);

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            dp[i] = max(dp[i + 1], questions[i][0] + dp[min(n, questions[i][1] + 1 + i)]);
        }

        return dp[0];
    }
};
```

## Explanation
We define a DP array dp[i] as:

The maximum points we can earn by solving questions starting from index i to the end.

We process dp in reverse (from the end of the array to the beginning), using the recurrence:

```C++
dp[i] = max(
    points[i] + dp[i + brainpower[i] + 1], // solve question i
    dp[i + 1]                              // skip question i
)
```
If we solve the question at index i, we get its points and jump ahead by brainpower[i] + 1 steps.

If we skip the question, we simply move to the next index (i + 1).

We initialize dp[n] = 0, meaning if there are no more questions, we earn 0 points.
