## Solution
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumSum(int n, int k) {
        int ret = 0;

        for (int i = 1, cnt = 0; cnt < n ; i++) {
            if (i <= k / 2 || k <= i) {
                ret += i;
                cnt++;
            }
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
```

## Explanation
To get the minimum sum, we want to use the smallest possible integers starting from 1.
However, to avoid any pair that sums to k, we must not include both x and k - x in the array.

So, our strategy is:

Start checking numbers from 1 upwards.

For each number i:

* If i < k / 2, itâ€™s safe to use.

* If i == k / 2, only one of i or k - i can be used (so still safe).

* If i >= k, it's always safe because no pair with i can sum to k.

Add valid numbers to the array until we've added n of them.

Sum them up for the result.

This greedy approach ensures we get the smallest possible valid elements.

## ðŸ§® Time Complexity:
O(k + n) at worst, which is acceptable because k â‰¤ 50.
