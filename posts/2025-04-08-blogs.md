**Paper:** *OAUTHLINT: An Empirical Study on OAuth Bugs in Android Applications*
---
---
### Key Insights:

- **Problem focus:** Misuse of OAuth APIs in Android apps, often due to misunderstanding the difference between authentication vs. authorization.
- **Tool-based static analysis:** OAUTHLINT combines pointer + taint analysis with a custom query language for detecting "anti-protocols" (misuse patterns).
- **Five common anti-protocols found:**
  - **Locally bundled secrets:** Secrets stored insecurely in the APK
  - **WebView-based OAuth flow:** Breaks security boundaries; enables cookie stealing
  - **Client-side API calls:** Client devices are untrusted; tokens should be exchanged server-side
  - **Insecure token storage:** Access tokens stored in plain SharedPreferences
  - **Sending raw tokens to backend servers:** Exposes backend to impersonation attacks
- **Evaluation:** Analyzed 600+ apps (316 used OAuth); 101 vulnerable apps; 69 with client-side API misuse.
- **Relevance:** Highlights real-world implementation mistakes in multi-stage security protocols, mirroring common misuses in vulnerability chain execution.
- **Methodological Strength:** Use of domain-specific static analysis + Datalog-based anti-pattern query language is a promising approach for generalized vulnerability chain misuse detection.
