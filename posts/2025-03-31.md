Given a string s and a character letter, return the percentage of characters in s that equal letter rounded down to the nearest whole percent.

## Solution
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int percentageLetter(string s, char letter) {
        int cnt = 0;

        for (char ch: s) {
            if (ch == letter) {
                cnt++;
            }
        }

        return cnt * 100 / s.length();
    }
};
```

## Explanation
Count the letter in the string and that's it.

## ðŸ§® Time Complexity:
O(n), where n equals to the length of the string s.
